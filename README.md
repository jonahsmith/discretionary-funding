This is an analysis of the FY2015 NYC Council discretionary funding expenditures, the first after reform on the distribution of the funding. I am looking to see how the spending has actually changed since the changes.

The data are available on the NYC Council website, but I have added some commentary and analysis.

This project is ongoing, but feel free to use the data or code as you wish.
