	Directly downloaded
	Convert to CSV using Excel
	Import into R (use fileEncoding="latin1")
	Combine datasets (2014 has X. column, 2015 has Status column. same? not merged)
	Variables:
		Source: factor; 145 levels, mostly "YOUTH", "POVERTY", "LOCAL", "AGING"

	used IMPORTHTML() in Google Docs to scrape current councilmembers
	same for historic councilmembers, but using July 26, 2013 entry in Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/web/20130726124226/http://council.nyc.gov/html/members/members.shtml)
	Combined the datasets and extracted last name for each person.
		manually fixed Van Bramer
	Merge the member information with funding information (by year + councilmember)
	Variables
		Council.Member
			changed the "Viverito" entries to "Mark-Viverito"
			change all the "" to NA
		Amount...
			remove "$" and ","
			convert to numeric
			odd: why is there a negative value? (call to ask)
		Zip.Code (moved to "Spending_Zip")
			leave only five-digit zip code
			remove second zip code, if given
	Downloaded zip code data from http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/appendix/neighborhoods.htm, pulled out each zip code/borough match, then smashed
	That zip code data isn't great, so I'll also try http://www.nycbynatives.com/nyc_info/new_york_city_zip_codes.php, which is less reputable but more up-to-date
	The alternative dataset reduces the number of NAs by about 250, equally dispersed through the distribution. That seems reasonable.

	Council.Member
		Remove "Delegation" and replace with nothing (match borough-wide spending between years)
		Replace "SI" with "Staten Island"
		Replace "CD 28" with "CD28"
		

	Notes: 
		CD28 is Council District 28. It is represented by Ruben Wills, who isn't allowed to spend his funding because he was arrested earlier this year for embezzling.
		CD19 was vacant before Vallone
		Need to figure out what CC is and whether it is the same as CITYWIDE
