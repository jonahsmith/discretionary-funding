	Directly downloaded
	Convert to CSV using Excel
	Import into R (use fileEncoding="latin1")
	Combine datasets (2014 has X. column, 2015 has Status column. same? not merged)
	Variables:
		Source: factor; 145 levels, mostly "YOUTH", "POVERTY", "LOCAL", "AGING"

	used IMPORTHTML() in Google Docs to scrape current councilmembers
	same for historic councilmembers, but using July 26, 2013 entry in Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/web/20130726124226/http://council.nyc.gov/html/members/members.shtml)
	Combined the datasets and extracted last name for each person.
		manually fixed Van Bramer
	Merge the member information with funding information (by year + councilmember)
	Variables
		Council.Member
			changed the "Viverito" entries to "Mark-Viverito"
			change all the "" to NA
		Amount...
			remove "$" and ","
			convert to numeric
			odd: why is there a negative value? (call to ask)
		Zip.Code (moved to "Spending_Zip")
			leave only five-digit zip code
			remove second zip code, if given
	Downloaded zip code data from http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/appendix/neighborhoods.htm, pulled out each zip code/borough match, then smashed
	That zip code data isn't great, so I'll also try http://www.nycbynatives.com/nyc_info/new_york_city_zip_codes.php, which is less reputable but more up-to-date
	The alternative dataset reduces the number of NAs by about 250, equally dispersed through the distribution. That seems reasonable.
			

==================
TO DO
[ ] Is it reasonable to remove " of _____ ____"? Probably, but need to make sure it's not in the middle of sentence?
